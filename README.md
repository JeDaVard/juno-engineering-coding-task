## Instructions
This coding task is used to evaluate new hires for Juno Journey's Engineering Team.
The whole task should take around 1.5 hours.

You should [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to your personal [Github](www.github.com) account.
Please create a pull request (to Juno-Journey/juno-engineering-coding-task, master branch) and add [Juno-Journey/Engineering](https://github.com/orgs/Juno-Journey/teams/engineering) as a reviewer.
All the code you write should work, should be clean, and use best practices you are familiar with.
<b>Testing is very recommended.</b>

Use ``` npm install ``` in the project root to set up.

## Structure
Your code should go under src/task1 & src/task2.
The api folder provides basic infrastructure to both tasks, and should be kept untouched.

## First Task:
Create an image carousel that looks similar to this (and not necessarily exact):
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/juno-multi-test.appspot.com/o/public%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=50efb126-617f-4abc-962d-e4770c2f9b8c"><br>
The carousel is circular - clicking "next" on the last image will show the first image, and clicking "previous" on the first image will show the last image.
Using material-UI components is a bonus. Please implement the carousel yourself, using third party libraries for this purpose is not allowed.

Use ``` npm run start ``` in the project root to run the carousel app.
